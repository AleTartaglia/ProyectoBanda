                <p class="biop"><strong><em>Kane Allen Brown</em></strong> (born October 21, 1993) is an American
                    country music singer and songwriter who first came to the attention of the public through social
                    media. He released his first EP, titled Closer, in June 2015. A new single, "Used to Love You
                    Sober", was released in October 2015. After Brown signed with RCA Nashville in early 2016, this song
                    was included on his EP Chapter 1, which was released in March 2016. He released his first
                    full-length album, the self-titled Kane Brown, on December 2, 2016. The single "What Ifs" was
                    released from this album and, in October 2017, Brown became the first artist to have simultaneous
                    number ones on all five main Billboard's country charts. Brown released his second album,
                    Experiment, in November 2018.</p>

                <h2 class="h2bio">Early life</h2>
                <p class="biop">Kane Allen Brown was raised in rural northwest Georgia and the Chattanooga, Tennessee
                    area. He is multiracial; his mother Tabatha Brown is white and his father is black and part
                    Cherokee.In 2018, he told People Magazine that he did not know he was biracial until he was 7 or 8
                    years old: "I thought I was full white... I found out that I was biracial and I still wasn’t
                    thinking anything of it, but then I started getting called the N-word ... I learned what it meant,
                    and that’s when it started affecting me. I got in fights over it when I was little." His father has
                    been incarcerated since 1996 and he was raised by his single mother. His family, sometimes homeless,
                    moved around when he was younger from Rossville to Fort Oglethorpe and LaFayette Georgia, finally
                    settling in Red Bank, Tennessee. As a result, he attended many schools, among them Lakeview-Fort
                    Oglethorpe High School in Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia where he sang in the choir with Lauren Alaina,
                    the runner-up on season 10 of American Idol. He also attended Red Bank, Ridgeland, and Soddy Daisy
                    High School. Kane grew up listening to country music, but became interested in R&B music in middle
                    school. However, after winning a school talent show in 11th grade with a rendition of Chris Young's
                    "Gettin' You Home", he began to perform country music.</p>

                <p class="biop">Brown auditioned on both American Idol and The X Factor after the success of his school
                    friend Lauren Alaina on American Idol. He was chosen for The X Factor after an audition in 2013, but
                    left the show when its producers wanted to include him in a boy band, after which he decided to post
                    his cover versions of popular songs online.</p>

                    Billy Currington, Alan Jackson and other singers on social media. He started to acquire a following
                    through these homemade videos on Facebook; an early video to gain wider attention was his cover of
                    Lee Brice's "I Don't Dance". His cover of George Strait's "Check Yes or No", released on September
                    30, 2015, went viral and received over seven million views. The number of his followers on Facebook
                    quickly reached over a million, and a clip of a teaser for his own single "Used to Love You Sober"
                    released on October 8, 2015 received one million views in under three hours, and reached over 11
                    million views two weeks later. Brown was initially signed to Zone 4,and Jay Frank was his first
